        <p>Most people that would assume that billionaire, playboy Bruce Wayne and vigilante Batman are the same person and while that may be technically true, it does not tell the complete story.</p> 
        <br>

        <p>When Bruce Wayne was around the age of nine or ten, his parents took him to the local movie theater to see Zorro. Shortly after the picture ended Bruce's parents, Martha and Thomas Wayne, were murdered in a random mugging in the back alley. While Bruce survived the attack some say that he also died that day and Batman was born.</p>

    <div id="Powers">
        <h2 class="Abilities">Abilities</h2>
        <p>Batman has no superhuman abilities which does limit what he can phsycially can do even though he is in peak human condition. What <strong>does<italicize></italicize></strong> set him apart is he is one of the most intelligent people on the planet. Batman is known as the worlds greatest detective. </p>
